2.2 Provide an example of a simple lambda expression.

->  Here's a simple example of a lambda expression in Java that represents a functional interface `Runnable`:

    Runnable myLambda = () -> {
        // Code to be executed
        System.out.println("Hello, Lambda!");
    };

    In this example, `() -> { /* Code */ }` is a lambda expression that represents a `Runnable`. 
    When `myLambda.run()` is called, it executes the code inside the lambda expression.

    Lambda expressions have significantly improved code readability and made it easier to work with 
    functional programming concepts in Java.
