3.2 Illustrate the use of the Consumer functional interface with examples

->  The Consumer functional interface in Java represents an operation that takes an input 
    and performs some action on it without returning a result. It's often used for actions like 
    printing, logging, or modifying objects.

    Exammple:
    import java.util.Arrays;
    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.function.Consumer;

    public class ConsumerExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date");

            // Using a Consumer to print each element
            Consumer<String> printFruit = (fruit) -> System.out.println("Fruit: " + fruit);

            fruits.forEach(printFruit);
        }
    }

    In this example, we create a Consumer called printFruit that takes a String and prints it. 
    We then use forEach to apply this Consumer to each element in the list, printing all the fruits.
