16.1  What is the Java Module System, and why was it introduced?

->  The Java Module System, introduced in Java 9, is a feature that brings modularity 
    to the Java platform. 
    
    Its primary purposes are:

    1. Encapsulation: 
        It allows developers to define clear boundaries (modules) around groups of related code, 
        encapsulating their internal details. This enhances code organization and reduces unintended 
        dependencies between parts of a program.

    2. Maintainability: 
        By promoting modular code, the module system makes it easier to manage and maintain 
        large-scale Java applications. It helps in isolating and updating specific modules without 
        affecting the entire application.

    3. Security: 
        Modules provide strong encapsulation, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to internal 
        code components. This enhances security by limiting the visibility of implementation details.

    In summary, the Java Module System was introduced to improve code organization, maintainability, 
    and security in Java applications by introducing a modular structure to the language.
