15.4  Describe the use of snippets, list, and drop commands in JShell.

->  Use of `snippets`, `list`, and `drop` commands in JShell:

    1. `snippets` Command:
        - Use the `snippets` command in JShell to display a list of all code snippets 
          entered during the current session.
        - It helps you keep track of the code you've executed interactively.

    2. `list` Command:
        - The `list` command is used to display a list of all valid code snippets 
          and classes defined in the current session.
        - It shows both successfully compiled code and code with errors.
        - Useful for reviewing your code and its outcomes.

    3. `drop` Command:
        - The `drop` command removes a code snippet or class definition from the current session.
        - Use it to discard code that you no longer need or to clear errors without restarting JShell.

    In summary, `snippets` lists the code snippets, `list` displays all code, and `drop` removes 
    unwanted code in your JShell session, making it easier to manage and explore Java code interactively.
