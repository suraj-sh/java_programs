25.1  Explain the enhancements made to switch expressions in Java 13.

->  In Java 13, enhancements to switch expressions include simplifying the syntax even further. 
    The `break` statement is no longer needed for individual case labels, making the code more 
    concise and readable.

    Example in Java 12 (prior to enhancement):

        int dayOfWeek = 3;
        String dayName = switch (dayOfWeek) {
            case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Weekday";
            case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
            default -> "Invalid";
        };

    Enhanced in Java 13:
    
        int dayOfWeek = 3;
        String dayName = switch (dayOfWeek) {
            case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Weekday";
            case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
            default -> "Invalid";
        };


    In this short and simple manner, Java 13 enhances switch expressions by removing the need 
    for explicit `break` statements within case labels, further improving code readability and brevity.
