17.1  Introduce the concept of factory methods for collections.

->  Factory methods for collections in Java are static methods provided by various collection 
    classes (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`) to create instances of those collections. 
    These factory methods offer a concise and convenient way to create and initialize collections.

    Example:

        List<String> list = List.of("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry");
        Set<Integer> set = Set.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);


    In this short and simple manner, factory methods make it easier to create immutable or 
    mutable collections with initial values, reducing the need for verbose constructor calls 
    and manual population of elements.
