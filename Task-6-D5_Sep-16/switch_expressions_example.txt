24.2  Provide an example of a switch expression with multiple cases and a default action.

->  Example of a switch expression with multiple cases and a default action:

        int month = 6;
        String season = switch (month) {
            case 12, 1, 2 -> "Winter";
            case 3, 4, 5 -> "Spring";
            case 6, 7, 8 -> "Summer";
            case 9, 10, 11 -> "Autumn";
            default -> "Unknown";
        };

    In this example:

    - We use multiple cases separated by commas to match multiple values for each season.
    - The `default` case handles any month not covered by the specific cases.
    - The switch expression returns the appropriate season based on the value of the `month` variable.
