17.2  Describe the advantages of using factory methods to create collections.

->  Advantages of using factory methods to create collections:

    1. Concise Initialization: 
        Factory methods provide a concise way to create and initialize collections 
        with values in a single line of code.

    2. Immutable Collections: 
        Factory methods allow the creation of immutable collections, 
        ensuring that the collection cannot be modified after creation, 
        which is useful for immutability and thread safety.

    3. Type Inference: 
        They offer type inference, making it unnecessary to specify the 
        data type of elements explicitly.

    4. Readability: 
        Factory method calls are often more readable than lengthy constructor 
        calls with initialization.

    5. Performance: 
        Factory methods return optimized collection implementations based on the 
        number of elements, potentially improving performance.

    Overall, factory methods simplify collection creation and improve code readability 
    while offering options for immutability and performance optimization.
