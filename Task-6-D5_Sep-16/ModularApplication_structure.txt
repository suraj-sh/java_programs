16.3  Explain how to create and structure a modular application.  

->  To create and structure a modular application in Java:

    1. Create Module Declarations:
        - Define modules using `module-info.java` files. Each module declares its name, 
          dependencies, and what it exports.

    2. Organize Code into Packages:
        - Organize your code into packages to group related classes together.

    3. Compile Modules:
        - Compile the modules using the `javac` command, specifying the module path 
          and module source path.

    4. Run the Application:
        - Run the application using the `java` command, specifying the main module and class.

    5. Repeat for Additional Modules:
        - If your application has multiple modules, repeat steps 1-4 for each module.

    This modular structure enhances code organization, maintainability, and encapsulation 
    while allowing you to manage dependencies between different parts of your application.
