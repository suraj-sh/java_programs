23.1  Describe the new HTTP Client API introduced in Java 11.

->  The new HTTP Client API introduced in Java 11 provides a modern and flexible way to 
    send HTTP requests and receive responses. It simplifies HTTP communication in Java 
    applications with features like asynchronous requests and reactive programming support.

    Key Points:

    - Modular and Efficient: 
        Part of the Java standard library, it's modular and efficient, suitable for 
        both traditional and microservices-based applications.

    - Async Support: 
        Supports asynchronous requests, allowing applications to continue 
        processing while waiting for responses.

    - Reactive Programming: 
        Integrates well with reactive programming libraries like Reactor and 
        RxJava for building reactive applications.

    - HTTP/2 Support: 
        Offers native support for HTTP/2, a more efficient and faster protocol.

    - Ease of Use: 
        Provides a straightforward API for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

    In a short and simple manner, the Java 11 HTTP Client API simplifies HTTP communication 
    and brings modern features to Java applications.
