22.2  Explain the purpose and use cases of the Epsilon GC.

->  The purpose and use cases of the Epsilon Garbage Collector (GC) in Java:

    Purpose:
        - Epsilon GC is designed for performance testing and debugging.
        - It serves as a "no-op" collector, not performing any memory reclamation.

    Use Cases:
        - Performance Testing: Use Epsilon GC to assess application performance with 
          garbage collection effectively turned off.
        - Debugging: It helps identify performance bottlenecks related to memory management.
        - Benchmarking: Useful for comparing application performance under different garbage 
          collection scenarios.

    In summary, Epsilon GC is used to measure the impact of garbage collection on performance 
    and debug memory-related issues in Java applications.
