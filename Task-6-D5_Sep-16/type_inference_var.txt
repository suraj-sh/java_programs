19.1  Introduce the concept of type inference with the var keyword.

->  Type inference with the `var` keyword is a feature in Java that allows 
    the compiler to automatically determine the data type of a variable based 
    on its initialization. It simplifies variable declarations by reducing the 
    need for explicit type annotations.

    Example:

        var number = 42; // Compiler infers the type as int
        var text = "Hello, Java!"; // Compiler infers the type as String

    In this short and simple manner, the `var` keyword enhances code readability and 
    reduces verbosity when declaring variables in Java.
