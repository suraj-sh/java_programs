24.1  Introduce the concept of switch expressions in Java 12.

->  Switch expressions in Java 12 introduce a more concise and expressive way to write switch statements. 
    They allow a switch to return a value directly, making code shorter and more readable.

    Example:

        int dayOfWeek = 3;
        String dayName = switch (dayOfWeek) {
            case 1 -> "Monday";
            case 2 -> "Tuesday";
            case 3 -> "Wednesday";
            case 4 -> "Thursday";
            case 5 -> "Friday";
            default -> "Weekend";
        };
        

    In a short and simple manner, switch expressions improve the readability and maintainability 
    of Java code by providing a more compact syntax for switch statements that return values.
