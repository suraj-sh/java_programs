18.1  Explain the purpose of the try-with-resources statement in Java.

->  Try-with-resources is typically used within a Java program to automatically 
    close resources like files, streams, or connections. 
    
    Here's a brief example of how it works within a Java program:

        import java.io.FileInputStream;
        import java.io.IOException;

        public class Example {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                try (FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("example.txt")) {
                    // Use the inputStream
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    // Handle exceptions
                }
            }
        }

    In this code, the `try-with-resources` statement ensures that the `FileInputStream` 
    is automatically closed when the block is exited, whether normally or due to an exception.
