23.2  How does the new HTTP Client API improve over the older HttpURLConnection?

->  The new HTTP Client API in Java 11 improves over the older HttpURLConnection in:

    1. Modern API: 
        The new API offers a more modern and user-friendly interface compared to the older, 
        verbose HttpURLConnection.

    2. Asynchronous Support: 
        It supports asynchronous requests, allowing applications to perform other tasks 
        while waiting for HTTP responses, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

    3. Reactive Programming: 
        Integrates well with reactive programming libraries, making it suitable for 
        building reactive and event-driven applications.

    4. HTTP/2 Native Support: 
        Provides native support for the efficient HTTP/2 protocol, which HttpURLConnection lacks.

    5. Easier Handling: 
        Simplifies request and response handling, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required.

    In summary, the new HTTP Client API is a more versatile, efficient, and modern solution 
    for handling HTTP requests and responses in Java applications compared to the older HttpURLConnection.
