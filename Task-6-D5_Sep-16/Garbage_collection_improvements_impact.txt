20.2  How do these improvements impact garbage collection efficiency?

->  These improvements impact garbage collection efficiency in:

    1. Reduced Pause Times: 
        The use of techniques like G1 and parallel/concurrent collectors reduces the pause times, 
        allowing applications to continue running with minimal interruptions.

    2. Adaptive Tuning: 
        Ergonomics helps Java adapt garbage collection settings for optimal performance, 
        reducing the need for manual tuning.

    3. Better Memory Management: 
        G1 collector and other enhancements manage memory more efficiently, 
        reducing fragmentation and improving overall memory usage.

    4. Low-Latency: 
        Garbage collection improvements make Java suitable for low-latency and real-time 
        applications where minimal pause times are crucial.

    In summary, these improvements make garbage collection in Java more efficient by 
    minimizing pause times, improving memory management, and enhancing adaptability.
