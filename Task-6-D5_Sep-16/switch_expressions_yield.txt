25.2  Demonstrate the usage of switch expressions with the yield keyword.

->  In Java, starting from version 14, you can use the `yield` keyword with 
    switch expressions to return a value from a case. 
    
    Here's an example:

        public enum Season {
            SPRING, SUMMER, AUTUMN, WINTER
        }

        public static String getSeasonDescription(Season season) {
            return switch (season) {
                case SPRING -> "Flowers are blooming.";
                case SUMMER -> "Enjoy the sun and warmth.";
                case AUTUMN -> "Leaves are falling.";
                case WINTER -> {
                    yield "Time for snow and holidays.";
                }
            };
        }
        

    In this example:

    - We define an enum `Season`.
    - The `getSeasonDescription` method uses a switch expression to provide a description 
      for each season.
    - The `WINTER` case uses the `yield` keyword to return a value, which is 
      "Time for snow and holidays."

    This demonstrates how you can use the `yield` keyword in a switch expression to return 
    a value from a specific case.
