22.1  Introduce the concept of the Epsilon Garbage Collector.

->  The Epsilon Garbage Collector is a specialized garbage collector introduced in Java 
    to serve as a "no-op" collector. It doesn't perform any memory reclamation and is 
    used primarily for performance testing and debugging purposes. It allows developers 
    to measure the performance impact of garbage collection in Java applications by 
    effectively turning off garbage collection.

    In a short and simple manner, the Epsilon Garbage Collector helps assess how an 
    application behaves when garbage collection is disabled, providing insights into 
    the impact of memory management on performance.
