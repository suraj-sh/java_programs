15.1  Explain how to set up Java environment variables for Java Shell (JShell).

->  To set up Java environment variables for Java Shell (JShell):

    1. Install Java:
        - First, ensure you have Java installed on your system.

    2. Set the `PATH` Variable:
        - Add the path to the Java executable (e.g., `java.exe` or `java` for macOS/Linux) 
          to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
        - This allows your system to locate the Java executable when you run JShell.

    With the `PATH` variable correctly configured, you can open a terminal or 
    command prompt and simply type `jshell` to start the Java Shell.

    Ensure you've installed Java correctly and that the `java` command works in your terminal 
    before setting up JShell.
