15.2  Introduce the concept of JShell (Java Shell) and its purpose.

->  JShell (Java Shell) is an interactive command-line tool introduced in Java 9 
    that provides a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for Java programming. 
    
    Its purpose is to:

    - Simplify Code Exploration: 
      JShell allows developers to quickly test Java code snippets, explore language features, 
      and experiment with APIs without the need to create full Java programs or compile code.

    - Rapid Prototyping: 
      It is valuable for prototyping, trying out new ideas, and debugging small code segments interactively.

    - Learning Tool: 
      JShell is an excellent educational tool for learning Java and understanding how various Java 
      constructs work in practice.

    - Debugging and Problem Solving: It helps in interactively diagnosing issues and testing solutions 
      in a controlled environment.

    In summary, JShell makes it easier for developers to interactively work with Java code, 
    speeding up the learning process and simplifying code exploration and debugging tasks.
