16.4  How does Maven support modular applications?

->  Maven supports modular applications in Java through its project 
    structure and dependency management:

    1. Project Structure: 
        Maven encourages modularization by organizing code into separate 
        modules (projects) within a multi-module project structure.

    2. Dependency Management: 
        Maven simplifies dependency management by allowing you to specify 
        dependencies between modules (projects) in the `pom.xml` files. 
        This makes it easy to declare and manage dependencies between modules 
        in your modular application.

    In summary, Maven's project structure and dependency management make it convenient 
    to develop, build, and manage modular applications by providing a clear way to 
    organize code into modules and specify module dependencies.
