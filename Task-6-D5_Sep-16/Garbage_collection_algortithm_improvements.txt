20.1  Explain the improvements made to the garbage collection algorithm in Java.

->  Improvements to the garbage collection algorithm in Java:

    1. G1 Garbage Collector: 
        The Garbage-First (G1) Garbage Collector introduced better memory management 
        and reduced pause times for applications with large heaps.

    2. Parallel and Concurrent: 
        Modern garbage collectors use parallel and concurrent techniques to minimize 
        application pause times, making Java more responsive.

    3. Ergonomics: 
        Java's garbage collectors have improved adaptive tuning (ergonomics) to automatically 
        adjust heap sizes and collector parameters for better performance.

    4. Low-Latency: 
        The focus has been on reducing garbage collection pause times, making Java more 
        suitable for real-time and interactive applications.

    In summary, these improvements enhance Java's garbage collection performance, 
    making it more efficient, responsive, and adaptable to various application scenarios.
