7.6 Explain the reduce() operation and its applications.

->  The `reduce()` operation in a stream is used to combine elements of a stream into 
    a single result by applying a binary operation. It repeatedly applies the operation 
    to the elements, accumulating a result as it processes the stream. 
    
    Here's an explanation of its purpose and applications:

    Purpose and Applications of `reduce()` Operation:
    - `reduce()` is used to perform calculations that aggregate or combine elements in a stream, 
      resulting in a single value.
    - Common applications include summing numbers, finding the maximum or minimum value, 
      and concatenating strings.
    - It can be used for custom operations that combine elements in a specific way.
    - It's particularly useful for reducing a stream of values to a single summary value.

    Example (Summing Numbers):

    import java.util.Arrays;
    import java.util.List;

    public class ReduceExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

            // Use reduce to calculate the sum of numbers
            int sum = numbers.stream()
                            .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);

            System.out.println("Sum of numbers: " + sum);
        }
    }

    In this example, the `reduce()` operation is used to calculate the sum of the numbers in the stream. 
    It starts with an initial value of 0 and repeatedly applies the addition operation to accumulate the sum. 
    The result is the sum of all the numbers in the list.

    The `reduce()` operation is versatile and can be used for various aggregation tasks, 
    making it a valuable tool for stream processing in Java.
