14.6  What is a ZonedDateTime and how does it handle time zones?

->  A `ZonedDateTime` represents a date and time along with its corresponding time zone information. 
    It handles time zones by including both the local date and time and the specific time zone offset, 
    allowing it to unambiguously identify a moment in time, even when considering daylight saving time 
    changes and time zone transitions.

    In `ZonedDateTime`, the time zone offset is automatically adjusted to account for daylight saving time, 
    making it suitable for applications that need to work with date and time information across different 
    time zones while considering local rules and adjustments.
