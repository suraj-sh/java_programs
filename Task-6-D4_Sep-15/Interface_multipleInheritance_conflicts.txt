13.5  Discuss how conflicts in multiple inheritance are resolved using interfaces.

->  In Java, conflicts in multiple inheritance are resolved using interfaces by 
    applying the following rules:

    1. Method Overriding: If a class implements multiple interfaces, and those interfaces contain 
       methods with the same signature, the class must provide its own implementation for that 
       method to resolve the conflict.

    2. Default Methods: If multiple interfaces provide default method implementations with the same name, 
       a conflict arises. In this case, the implementing class must override the conflicting method to 
       specify which implementation to use.

    3. Interface Order: If a class implements multiple interfaces, and those interfaces have default 
       methods with the same name, the method from the first interface listed in the class's `implements` 
       clause takes precedence.

    These rules ensure that conflicts in multiple inheritance are resolved by requiring the implementing 
    class to explicitly specify which method implementation to use, either by providing its own implementation 
    or by determining the order of precedence based on the interface order in the `implements` clause.
