14.4  How can you represent durations using the Duration class?

->  You can represent durations using the `Duration` class in Java by specifying the 
    amount of time in seconds and nanoseconds:

    Duration duration = Duration.ofSeconds(30); // Represents 30 seconds

    You can also include nanoseconds:

    Duration duration = Duration.ofSeconds(30, 500_000_000); // Represents 30 seconds and 500 milliseconds

    Once you have a `Duration` instance, you can perform various operations like addition, 
    subtraction, and comparisons to work with durations in your Java code. 
    This class is particularly useful for measuring and working with time intervals.
