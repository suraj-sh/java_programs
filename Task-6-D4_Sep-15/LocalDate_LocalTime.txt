14.2  How do you create and manipulate instances of LocalDate and LocalTime?

->  To create and manipulate instances of `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` in Java, 
    you can follow these simple steps:

    Creating `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` Instances:

    1. Creating a `LocalDate` Instance:

        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2023, 9, 15); // Year, Month, Day


    2. Creating a `LocalTime` Instance:
    
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.of(14, 30, 0); // Hour, Minute, Second


    Manipulating `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` Instances:

    3. Adding or Subtracting Time:

        LocalDate newDate = date.plusDays(7); // Adding 7 days to date
        LocalTime newTime = time.minusHours(2); // Subtracting 2 hours from time


    4. Getting Components (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second):

        int year = date.getYear();
        Month month = date.getMonth();
        int dayOfMonth = date.getDayOfMonth();
        int hour = time.getHour();
        int minute = time.getMinute();
        int second = time.getSecond();

    5. Formatting as a String:

        String formattedDate = date.toString(); // "2023-09-15"
        String formattedTime = time.toString(); // "14:30:00"


    These are some basic operations for creating and manipulating `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` 
    instances in Java. You can perform various other operations, such as comparisons 
    and calculations, based on your specific requirements.
