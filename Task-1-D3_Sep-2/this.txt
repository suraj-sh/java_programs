2.8 How does the this keyword work in Java? Illustrate its usage.

->  In Java, the this keyword is a reference to the current instance of a class. 
    It is used to differentiate between instance variables (class members) 
    and method parameters or local variables that have the same name. 
    'this' is primarily used within instance methods and constructors to access 
    or modify instance variables.

    Example:
    public class Person{

        private String name;
        private int age;

        public Person(String name, int age){

            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        public void printDetails(){

            System.out.println("Name: " + this.name); // Using 'this' to access instance variable
            System.out.println("Age: " + this.age);   // Using 'this' to access instance variable
        }

        public static void main(String[] args){
            
            Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
            Person person2 = new Person("Bob", 30);

            person1.printDetails();
            person2.printDetails();
        }
    }
