7. Discuss the differences between the print and println methods when used for console output.

->  The `print` and `println` methods are both used for console output in Java, 
    but they differ in how they handle the cursor position after printing. 
    The `print` method displays the output without moving to the next line, 
    keeping the cursor on the same line. 
    
    On the other hand, the `println` method also displays output but moves the cursor to the next line afterward. 
    This makes `print` suitable for displaying multiple outputs on the same line, while `println` is useful 
    when you want each output to appear on a new line.
